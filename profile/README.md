# Furry developers

## What is this organisation all about?

A loose collective of furry developers who want to share some open source love with the community. This organisation is there for bringing together the coders in our community.

The scope will be shaped more clearly as time goes on. If there is already a similar group which lines up with the same ideas, I am more than happy to close and move to this one. :3

See Issues page for discussion.

Simply drop a note in the issues or poke me on Telegram @token - we will automate this in the future!
